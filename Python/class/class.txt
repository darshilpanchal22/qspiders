it is container which use to store the properties and funcnalities of a real time entity 
object = it is copy or instance of class   
syntax and class creation 
class cname:
      -properties/functionalities
objname=Cname()
here cname that is should start with 
there are 2 type of class
in-build class
user-defined class

1 in-built class

all the data types are in built class because they are predefined by the developers

2 user defined class
the class which is created by the user based on recruitement of user is called as user defined class

 specific = the properties or functtionalities which will be created outside the class and which will be different for each and every object ar called as specific state  
object members are created after  creation objects   

properties of class
class Cname:
      property1= value1
      property2= value2

      accesing properties of class

= modification of class 
using class  Cname.propertyname=new value1
using object propertyname.name

object are dependents on class / objects are copy of class 
modification with respect ot objects

modification done with respect to object will affect only for that particular object the class other objects will be uneffected
 class are not depended on objects                    
 the properties or functionalities are storing inside the class are called as states
 types of states
  generic states = the properties or functionalities which will be declared inside the class and common  each  and every object are called as generic states
